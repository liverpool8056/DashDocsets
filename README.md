# DashDocsets

[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager.
This repo contains some customzied docset that are generated by following this [instruction](https://kapeli.com/docsets#dashDocset)

## How to use docsets

<docsetName>.docset in this repo can be imported into Dash directly.

## How to generate self-owned docset

`dash_docset_init.sh`: This script helps to create a skeleton of a docset directory. The rest of the things to be done according to Dash's [instruction](https://kapeli.com/docsets#dashDocset):

1. Retrieve/generate all the html files from the original docs, and put them under <docsetName>.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents
2. Create a sqlite database file at <docsetName>.docset/Contents/Resources/docSet.dsidx
3. Modify Info.plist;

## Set a Main Page

You can specify the main page that Dash shows when the user opens a docset by adding the following to Info.plist:

```
<key>dashIndexFilePath</key>
<string>index.html</string>
```

The path should be relative to the Documents folder inside the docset. It can also be a http:// URL.

After adding the main page, remove and re-add the docset in Dash's Preferences.
